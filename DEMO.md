# Running the demo

Everything needed is in this folder. No database to install, no administrator
rights, nothing added to the machine outside this folder.

---

## Start it

**Windows** — double-click **`demo.bat`**

**macOS / Linux** — in Terminal:

```bash
cd path/to/finops
./demo.sh
```

The first run takes about a minute while it sets itself up. After that it starts
in a few seconds. Your browser opens automatically at **http://127.0.0.1:8080**.

**Sign in:** `admin@oswalgroup.net` · `demo1234`

Leave the window open — that window *is* the server. Press **Ctrl+C** in it to stop.

## Two ways to run the demo

### A. Show the upload — the fuller story

Start it normally (`demo.bat` or `./demo.sh`). The portal opens empty.

1. **GST 80:20 Input Credit** on the home page
2. **New calculation**
3. Attach the three files from the **`demo-inputs`** folder:
   - `DayBookRegister.xlsx`
   - `Search Voucher.xlsx`
   - `Creditors Details.xlsx`
4. **Run the calculation** — it takes a few seconds and lands straight on the result

### B. Start with figures already on screen — safer if time is short

```
demo.bat -Seed          (Windows)
./demo.sh --seed        (macOS / Linux)
```

July 2026 is already calculated when the portal opens, so you begin on a
populated dashboard. The three files are still in `demo-inputs` if you want to
show the upload afterwards.

## A ten-minute walkthrough

| | Where | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Home page | Five solutions for Accounts & Finance. GST 80:20 is live; the others are the roadmap on the same portal. |
| 2 | GST 80:20 → Overview | The July aggregate registered share is **81.20%**, but **one project is below 80%**. The headline is context; the project table owns the shortfall test. |
| 3 | Same page, By project | Orchard Amritaya is at **79.04%** with a provisional ₹2,52,171.68 gap (₹45,390.90 at the configurable 18% rate). Rajarhat and Titagarh are above 80%; their surpluses do not erase Orchard's gap. |
| 4 | Review queue | The golden workbook flags **20 review items**. Decisions and GSTIN follow-up are audited annotations; the saved golden classifications do not change until corrected source files are uploaded in a new draft run. |
| 5 | Unregistered suppliers | Filter the list by a project before discussing procurement actions. A cross-project supplier ranking cannot itself close a particular project's gap. |
| 6 | Exceptions | Inspect credit-side entries and **3 July rows with a bad-checksum GSTIN**. This structural warning does not alter the Python classification. Source Daybook narration is visible here and in the Data Quality export; the golden 80-20 Table narration stays blank. |
| 7 | Creditors & GSTIN | Enter and validate confirmed GSTINs for follow-up, then ensure they are carried into the next uploaded Creditors export so the golden calculation can use them. |
| 8 | Masters | The Python keyword list and party rules are locked. Only the Python script's interactive Fixed/Parent Group selection changes source rows; leave the July selection unchanged for the parity demonstration. |
| 9 | Audit trail | Who changed what, when. This is what explains a movement in the percentage to an auditor. |

The folder contains only genuine July inputs. Do not present a second run of July
as another month: it supersedes the earlier July draft. A synthetic August
date-shift is used in automated testing, not as an Oswal August result.

## Other options

```
demo.bat -Reset            start over with an empty database
demo.bat -Port 9000        use a different port if 8080 is taken
./demo.sh --reset
./demo.sh --port 9000
```

To reset completely, stop the server and delete the `var` folder — that is the
entire demo database.

---

## If something goes wrong

**"Python was not found"** — install Python 3.11 or newer from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and tick *Add python.exe
to PATH* during setup. On macOS: `brew install python@3.12`.

**"Port already in use"** — something else is on 8080. Use `-Port 9000` /
`--port 9000` and open `http://127.0.0.1:9000`.

**The browser did not open** — the server is still running. Type the address in
manually: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

**The page will not load** — check the window you started it from; any error is
printed there.

**Anything odd after fiddling with settings** — `demo.bat -Reset` /
`./demo.sh --reset` puts it back to empty, then re-seed if you want.

## Worth knowing before you present

- The database is a single file at `var/finops.db`. That is right for a laptop
  demo; a real deployment uses PostgreSQL, which the installer sets up. See
  `QUICKSTART.md` and `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- The demo password is deliberately simple. A real install generates one.
- Nothing leaves the machine. The portal serves every asset itself and makes no
  outbound calls, so it works with the wi-fi off — worth demonstrating if data
  residency comes up.
- The figures on screen are computed live from the July 2026 exports, not
  hard-coded. Editing a master and re-running visibly changes them.
