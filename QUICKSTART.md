# Quick start

Copy this folder to the server, then run one command.

For a Windows PC, double-click `deploy.bat` instead. It installs the Python
packages, creates a local database, starts the portal and opens the browser.
If port 8080 is occupied, it automatically selects the next available port.
Each PC keeps its own independent SQLite database. You can optionally choose
an existing Google Drive mirrored folder for dated backups; it is not used
to load or synchronize the database. See `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
It attempts to install Python 3.12 through `winget` if Python 3.11+ is not
already available. If corporate policy blocks that, install Python manually.
The first-run administrator password is printed in the console; keep it private
and change it after signing in.
New calculations are read-only until that PC has a signed licence at
`var/license.json`. The 14-day term starts on first valid use, not installation.

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

**Windows Server** — right-click `install.ps1` and choose *Run with PowerShell*, or from an
elevated prompt:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

That is the whole install. It checks Python, builds an isolated environment, installs the
dependencies, creates the PostgreSQL database and role, generates the secret key and the first
administrator password, registers the portal to start with the machine, and confirms it is
serving before it finishes. When it is done it prints the address to open and the credentials to
sign in with.

Then:

1. Open the address it printed.
2. Sign in with the email and password shown.
3. Change that password under **Administration → Users** — the banner on the home page says so
   until you do, and doing it deletes the copy the installer left on the server.
4. **GST 80:20 → New calculation**, and upload the month's three Tally exports.

### If something is missing

The installer stops with a plain explanation rather than a stack trace, and tells you what to
install. The two common cases:

**No Python.** Install 3.11 or newer and run it again.

| | |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu / Debian | `sudo apt install python3 python3-venv` |
| RHEL / Rocky | `sudo dnf install python3` |
| Windows | [python.org/downloads/windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) — tick *Add python.exe to PATH* |

**No PostgreSQL.** The installer says so and uses a local SQLite file instead, so the portal
works immediately. That is fine for a pilot or a single preparer. Install PostgreSQL and re-run
the installer when several people need it at once.

**No internet on the server.** Build the dependency bundle on a machine that has internet and is
running the same operating system and Python version, then copy the whole folder across:

```bash
./make-offline-bundle.sh     # on the connected machine
sudo ./install.sh            # on the server — it finds wheelhouse/ automatically
```

---

### Other things you may want

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --port 9000    # serve on a different port
sudo ./install.sh --sqlite       # skip PostgreSQL even if it is installed
./install.sh --no-service        # install without registering a startup service
sudo ./install.sh --uninstall    # stop and remove the service; data is left alone
sudo ./install.sh                # run it again any time to upgrade in place
```

Re-running is safe. It never touches the database contents, and it keeps your `.env` — including
the database password — exactly as it is.

`DEPLOYMENT.md` covers the rest: HTTPS, backups, and adding the next module.
