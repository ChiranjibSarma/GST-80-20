# GST 80:20 Finance Operations Portal

A web application for the Accounts & Finance department. The portal home page is a
catalogue of solutions; the first live module is the
**GST 80:20 Input Credit** calculation. Its calculation engine is a web-safe port of
the client-approved `reference/80-20.py` script.

## Calculation authority

The attached legacy Python file is the golden source for filtering, party resolution,
GSTIN matching, keyword treatment, bank handling, RCM behaviour, approved party
corrections, and the duplicate-CGST repair. `tests/test_golden_workbook.py` compares
all 1,232 detail rows and all 20 review items with the approved July workbook.
`tests/test_app_workflow.py` verifies that upload, persistence, and download preserve
those exact results.

No email-only GST/RCM rule, stored keyword edit or manual ledger override changes
new calculations. The Python script controls line selection, party and GSTIN
resolution, eligibility, GST status, reviews and the four canonical workbook
sheets. Project gap/exposure and supplier rankings are clearly labelled
supplementary views computed from those saved rows, never alternative inputs
to the Python calculation.

Everything is served from the application itself — no CDN, no web fonts, no outbound
internet — so it runs on an isolated network.

**Demoing it on a laptop? See `DEMO.md`** — double-click `demo.bat` on Windows, or run
`./demo.sh` on macOS/Linux. No database, no administrator rights.

**Starting on a fresh Windows PC?** Double-click `deploy.bat`. If Python 3.11+
is absent, it attempts a per-user Python 3.12 install through Windows Package
Manager (`winget`); if that is unavailable or restricted, install Python manually
and select *Add Python to PATH*. It uses `install.ps1` to create `.venv`,
install `requirements.txt` (from the internet or an optional local `wheelhouse/`),
prepare a local SQLite database and generate the initial administrator password.
On first launch it optionally asks for an existing **mirrored** client-only
Google Drive folder for dated backups. The live SQLite database remains local
and is never loaded from or published as a shared Drive copy. A dated,
integrity-checked backup is made after the first successful calculation each day.
It then starts the portal at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and opens a browser. Keep the
console open; Ctrl+C stops the server. Use `deploy.bat 8081` for a different port.
If the requested port is occupied, the launcher automatically uses the next
available port and opens the browser at that address.
This launcher binds only to the local PC. Each installation has an independent
database; the app does not synchronize users' records across PCs.
See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for backup and recovery steps.

Three first-run wrappers are provided. Give `install_from_github.bat` to someone
with access to the GitHub repository and internet. It installs Git if needed,
prompts for GitHub sign-in when the repository is private, clones into the
PC's `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GST-80-20` folder, and starts `deploy.bat`. Alternatively,
download the complete repository ZIP, extract it to a non-synced local folder,
and run `install_from_download.bat` inside that folder. Both accept an optional
starting port, for example `install_from_download.bat 8081`. Neither wrapper
updates or overwrites an existing database. The GitHub wrapper reuses an
existing installation rather than pulling new code; upgrades need a separate,
backed-up process.

For a controlled client handoff, distribute `install_from_zip.bat` separately
from the repository archive. It installs a selected repository ZIP into the
local `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GST-80-20` folder, prepares the PC, displays its unique
installation ID, and then asks for a separately supplied licence JSON. If the
licence has not been issued yet, leave the prompt blank and rerun the same BAT
after receiving it. The BAT validates the signature and installation binding
before copying it into `var/license.json`. Licence-generation code and the
private signing key are issuer-only and are not shipped in this repository.

Each PC requires its own signed 14-day licence file, activated on first valid
use. After expiry, existing results and exports stay readable but new changes
are blocked. The private signing key must remain with the issuer, not on client
PCs or in Git. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for licence issuance and installation.

Only source code and the original `reference/80-20.py` are intended for GitHub.
Client Excel exports and the approved July output are ignored. The workbook
parity and HTTP tests require those private files to be placed back under
`reference/` locally; `seed_demo.py` likewise requires private `demo-inputs/`.

To install it on a server, one command — see **QUICKSTART.md**:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh          # Linux/macOS
.\install.ps1              # Windows Server
```

**DEPLOYMENT.md** covers HTTPS, backups, air-gapped servers and adding the next module.

## What the GST 80:20 module does

Under Notification 03/2019-CT(Rate), a promoter must buy at least 80% of inputs and
input services from registered suppliers, tested **per project for the financial year**,
with tax payable on any shortfall. This module measures that position and shows what is
still movable.

### Every month

1. **New calculation** — download the three input templates on that page, then
   upload matching Day Book, Search Voucher and Creditors exports. The first
   worksheet contains the exact expected Tally headers; the second explains
   the fields. Uploading a blank template is rejected.
2. The module resolves the party behind every cost line, applies the rules, and stores
   the result as a permanent snapshot.
3. Work the **review queue** for items identified by the golden script.
4. **Freeze month** when the calculation has been approved.

Freezing is permanent through the application. A frozen month cannot be replaced by
a new upload and its review decisions cannot be edited. Reporting and downloads remain
available, and the freeze actor and timestamp are permanently audited.
Existing frozen snapshots are not rewritten when the calculation engine changes;
their exported "Masters Used" tab shows the settings originally saved with them.

Re-running a month does not overwrite anything: the earlier run is kept and marked
superseded, and decisions already made are carried forward to the new run.

### The rules

| | |
|---|---|
| Voucher key | `Date \| Voucher_Type \| Voucher_No` — the number alone repeats across types |
| Party | resolves from the Approved Search Voucher, prioritising a matching GST-bearing creditor, then the largest credit-only non-tax line |
| Reverse charge | evaluated for the **whole voucher** — the same voucher books both an "…on RCM" liability line and a separate GST cost line, so a per-line check misses it |
| Eligibility | Mirrors the golden script: keywords match `Account_Name` only, plus its two approved always-ineligible ledgers |
| GST status | Mirrors the golden script: populated GST No. → Registered; blank → Unregistered, with the approved bank exception |
| Head | Every included transaction is reported as `Expenses`, matching the approved workbook |

The approved script's specific party/GST corrections and bank behaviour are retained
in `app/engine/golden.py`. Changing them requires a newly approved golden fixture and
a corresponding regression-test update.

### What each page is for

| Page | |
|---|---|
| Overview / Year to date | The financial-year position per project. A single month is an indicator; this is the test |
| Run detail | One month, with the summary pivot and where to look next |
| 80-20 table | Every reportable line, filterable, exactly as the original spreadsheet |
| Rectification queue | Assign, decide and record. A GSTIN entered here updates the follow-up master; it must also be present in the next uploaded Creditors export to affect a calculation. |
| Unregistered suppliers | Ranked by spend, spelling variants grouped, so it is clear which few relationships would move the percentage |
| Exceptions | Credit-side reallocation JVs, invalid GSTINs, parties that resolved to a round-off or bank ledger |
| Creditors & GSTIN | The master, plus a fill-in sheet to hand out and import back |
| Archived ledger corrections | Historical settings remain visible for audit but can no longer change new calculations. Correct the source exports or approve a revised Python file. |
| Masters | The Python keyword list is locked. Its interactive Fixed/Parent Group selections remain available; dashboard-only thresholds are separate. |
| Audit trail | Who changed what, permanently |

---

## Roles

| Role | |
|---|---|
| **Administrator** | everything, plus users and masters |
| **Preparer** | uploads files, runs calculations, resolves rectifications, edits the GSTIN master |
| **Viewer** | reads results and reports; cannot change anything |

Every change is written to the audit trail with the person's name — which is what
explains a movement in the registered percentage to an auditor.

---

## Running the tests

On a development machine, install `requirements-dev.txt` into the virtual
environment first. The workbook tests also need the private July files under
`reference/`; those files are intentionally not in GitHub.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m tests.test_rules             # single-engine and Python-rule checks
python -m tests.test_golden_workbook   # exact 1,232-row/20-review comparison
python -m tests.test_app_workflow      # upload, export, audit and permanent freeze
python -m tests.test_august_synthetic  # date-shift regression, not real August
```

---

## A note on the exposure figure

The shortfall amount and the tax on it are **indicators**, built from rates that are
editable on the Masters page. Confirm the rates and the computation basis with your GST
advisor before using the figure in a filing. Review flags do not change the golden
Registered/Unregistered classification; they identify records for follow-up.
The app additionally shows the source Daybook narration and flags structurally
invalid GSTINs on Data Quality views. The email no longer supplies competing
classification rules.
The four approved workbook sheets remain unchanged; the source script's
Narration column is intentionally blank in the canonical 80-20 Table export.
